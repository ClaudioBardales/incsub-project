# Incsub Form Project

This project is to showcase my form validation skills using ReactJS to a company.

## About This Project

I did this same project, but in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the company incsub came to me to see how good my skills were they told me to make this form validation page in ReactJS. I never done it so it was a challenge for me. I am thinking about adding some backend validation to this form and make it a full stack application with firebase.

## Setup

Clone this repo to your desktop and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

You might want to look into config.json to make change the port you want to use and set up a SSL certificate.
